## Yata -- Yet Another Tail Application ##

Yata is a general purpose log viewer and file monitor with a nice pretty GUI.  "Yata" is an acronym for "Yet Another Tail Application", so named because of its focus on viewing logs in real time (similar to what one might use "tail -f" on the unix command line for). Another possible rendering of "yata" is "Yata Ain't TAil!", for yata does not just replicate the functionality of the unix tail command in a GUI. For instance, here is a short list of current features:
  * Ability to open large files quickly, and fast scrolling to anywhere in the file
  * Searching and highlighting by regular expression
  * Viewing real-time changes to a file, with or without highlighting

Currently targeted platforms are Linux and Windows.

### 2013-03-30: Yata development beginning again ###
After a long hiatus, I am continuing development on Yata again. A lot has happened in my personal life over the past year that has prevented me from focussing on this project (i.e., new baby, new job, etc.), but I'm now committed to pushing out some new features over the next few months.

Thank you to everyone who has tried it out despite my warnings that it's prerelease software, and thank you especially to those of you who have submitted bug reports! I'm going through them now, and can hopefully do some fixing soon.

### 2012-02-23: Yata 0.2 has been released! ###

The latest version of Yata is 0.2.0. While still an alpha release, this new version has a few improvements over 0.1; namely the ability to select and copy text and customizing text colors. Many thanks to people who have downloaded the first version so far. I hope the second version works even better! If you have any feedback, please send me an email.

### Downloading Yata ###

To download Yata, please click on the download tab and select the package most appropriate for your platform. For windows, you can download the installer executable. For all other platforms, the source code package is available.

If you want to get the absolute latest version, another option is to check out the source code in the git repository (please see the Source tab at the top of this page). Instructions for building can be found in the readme.txt of the source tree.

Please note that yata is currently **alpha** quality software; please do not use for anything mission critical! In the future, I hope to have debian and rpm packages for linux  available.

### Participating in Yata ###

If you are interested in participating in this project, or if you are simply interested in using the application (I'd love to hear from you!), please send a message to yata dot development at gmail dot com.
